                Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.
                All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes. 
                The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers is not subject to the shouldComponentUpdate method, 
                so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component bails out of the update. */}
