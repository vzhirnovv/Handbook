### Methods and pointer indirection

Functions with a pointer argument **must take a pointer**:

```
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
```

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

For the statement `v.Scale(5)`, even though `v` is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement `v.Scale(5)` as `(&v).Scale(5)` since the `Scale` method has a pointer receiver.

**The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.**

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!
```

while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
p := &v
fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK
```

In this case, the method call p.Abs() is interpreted as (\*p).Abs().
