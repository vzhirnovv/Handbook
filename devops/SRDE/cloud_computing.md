# Cloud Computing

## Types of cloud

* IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - self-configured, a lot of control (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* PaaS (Platform as a Service) - pre-configured, some leverage over the infrastructure, mostly automated (OpenShift, Docker)
* SaaS (Software as a Service) - a complete service that does not require installation (Gmail, Photoshop)

These three decrease in the magnitude of control.

## Cloud deployment models

* Public cloud
* Private cloud
* Hybrid cloud

### Public cloud

Accessible for anyone through the public Internet (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean).

### Private cloud

Built on-premise, may be access-restricted on a certain network (OpenStack).

### Hybrid cloud

Both variants are used for specific business purposes.
